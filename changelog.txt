    IF YOU ARE UPDATING FROM 1.24.24 to 1.25.25, READ THE FOLLOWING:
    Because of the changes made with the item id handling, lit and unlit torches in inventory will disappear once you load a world after updating. Also, torches that are dropped in the world may cause crashes.
    If you want to keep your torches and not crash, do the following:

    1. Load your world BEFORE updating
    2. Take ALL your torches; lit and unlit
    3. PLACE them in the world. Do NOT throw them down. Place them down AS A BLOCK.
    4. Save your world and update to the new version

    Things should be fine by then. Take the torches back and do whatever you want with them.

1.24.24 (MC 1.4.7)
    - fixed a sort of kind of maybe not really an issue with compatibility
    - improved the recipe for a stick from unlit torches
